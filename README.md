# IPCA with RKHS Ridge Regression

### Machine Learning course (CS-433)

## General information 

This repository contains the report and code for the second project of Machine Learning course (CS-433).

## Team

Our team is composed by:
- Andrea Belvisi
- Michelangelo D'Andrea
- Matteo Ferrazzi

## Project

The project 

## Dataset



## Code structure 

- 'download_clean_data.py' contains the functions to download and clean the data.
- 'ipca.py' contains the funtions to run IPCA and IPCA regularized.
- 'kernel_regression.py' contains the functions that run kernel regressions and kernel regressions using low rank approximation.
- 'metrics.py' contains the functions to evaluate the performance of the models we implemented.
- 'validation.py' contains the functions to perform the validation of the models we implemented.
- 'validation_run.ipynb' contains the code to run the validation in order to obtain the best parameters for each model.
- 'run.ipynb' contains the code that produces the final results of our analysis.

## Libraries 

- Numpy : used to manipulate arrays and matrices, and perform linear algebra operations.
- Pandas : used to manipulate datasets.
- Seaborn : used for visualization.
- Matplotlib : used for visualization.
- Importlib : used to import modules.
- Pickle : used to store the results of the validation in dictionaries.

## Usage

You need to clone this repository.

Then 

Finally you can run the 'run.ipynb' to get submissions.
